                            Combinated from NFT and ICONee, this web application is a platform for trading a special type of token.
                        </p>
                        <p className='para-2'>
                            Unlike NFT - ICR3, which can be minted into multiple copies, this token represents something particularly unique in the world (such as  artworks, limited items, or even houses, etc.). And the price can never be changed except for deletion or auction.
                        </p>
                        <p className='para-1'>
                            Due to have high competitiveness, this token is also purchased in a special way.
                        </p>
                        <p className='para-2'>
                            It is impossible to purchase any NFT right away but through Send Request method. Once the first Request is sent, there will be a 24-hour countdown to wait for the second Request.
                        </p>
                        <p className='para-2'>
                            Useless there is the second Request, after 24 hours, that NFT will automatically belongs to that single Request.
                        </p>
                        <p className='para-2'>
                            Otherwise, an auction will be opened automatically after 24 hours with the same amount of time for its duration since the first Request. But the owner can still custom its duration, limit bid and start at any time. Once started, the first Request becomes the first bidder immediately. The final bidder will be the owner.
                        </p>

                            The new owner will have fully access to that NFT ,in contrary, the old owner will lose all control and can only own it through an acquisition.
